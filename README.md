## Features

- **3D Physics Simulation**: Realistic physics using engines like OIMO or AMMO.
- **Interactive Components**: Includes rollers, balls, and machine parts like `L_pale1`, `L_pale2`, etc.
- **Customizable Environment**: Adjustable lighting, camera, and environment settings.
- **Dynamic Textures**: Balls with unique colors and numbers.
